Assignment 1.0.A
================

This repository contains the data for assignment 1.0.A.
You should create solution files for the problems in the `problems/` directory.
The repository also contains `example-problems` along with `example-solutions` that you can use for testing your implementation.

#### `verify.py`
You can use `verify.py` to check your solutions for the example problems.
It will send them to a server and print out some feedback.
It requires the `requests` package (`python3 -m pip install requests`).
Then you can run the script with:
```
python3 verify.py path/to/your/example/solutions
```
